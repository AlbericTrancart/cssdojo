## About

I know, I know... you may think that [**C**SS **S**ometimes **S**ucks](https://talks.codemotion.com/why-css-sometimes-sucks). But it's not a fatality.

There is a alternate future, a parallel universe, in which this is not the case.

cssdojo is the place to learn the concepts that will allow you to have fun with CSS and face any CSS issue with confidence.
